Fibonacci Sum
Send Feedback
The fibonacci sequence is defined by the following relation:
 F(0) = 0
 F(1) = 1
 F(N) = F(N - 1) + F(N - 2), N >= 2
Your task is very simple. Given two non-negative integers N and M (N <= M), you have to calculate and return the sum (F(N) + F(N + 1) + ... + F(M)) mod 1000000007.
