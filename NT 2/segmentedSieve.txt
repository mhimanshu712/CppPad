In this problem you have to print all primes from given interval.
Input
t - the number of test cases, then t lines follows. [t <= 150]
On each line are written two integers L and U separated by a blank. L - lower bound of 
interval, U - upper bound of interval. [2 <= L < U <= 2147483647] [U-L <= 1000000].
Output
For each test case output must contain all primes from interval [L; U] in increasing order.
Sample Input:
2
2 10
3 7
Sample Output:
2
3
5
7
3
5
7
