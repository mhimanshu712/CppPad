SUBXOR
Send Feedback
A straightforward question. Given an array of positive integers you have to print the number of subarrays whose XOR is less than K. Subarrays are defined as a sequence of continuous elements Ai, Ai+1, ..., Aj . XOR of a subarray is defined as Ai ^ Ai+1 ^ ... ^ Aj. Symbol ^ is Exclusive Or.
Input Format
First line contains T, the number of test cases. 
Each of the test case consists of N and K in one line, followed by N space separated integers in next line.
Output Format
For each test case, print the required answer.
Constraints:
1 ≤ T ≤ 5
1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5
1 ≤ A[i] ≤ 10^5
1 ≤ K ≤ 10^6
