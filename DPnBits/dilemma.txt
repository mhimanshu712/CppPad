Abhishek, a blind man recently bought N binary strings all of equal length .A binary string only contains '0's and '1's . The strings are numbered from 1 to N and all are distinct, but Abhishek can only differentiate between these strings by touching them. In one touch Abhishek can identify one character at a position of a string from the set. Find the minimum number of touches T Abhishek has to make so that he learn that all strings are different .
Constraints :
2<=N<=10
1<=|L|<=100 , L is length of the strings .
Input Format:
Line 1 : An Integer N, denoting the number of binary strings .
Next N lines : strings of equal length
Output Format:
Return the minimum number of touches
