Palindromic Substrings
Send Feedback
Given a string S, count and return the number of substrings of S that are palindrome.
Single length substrings are also palindromes. You just need to calculate the count, not the substrings.
Input Format :
String S
Output Format :
count of palindrome substrings
Constraints :
1 <= Length of S <= 1000
Sample Input :
aba
Sample Output :
4
**Note : Here 4 corresponds to ("a","b","a","aba").
