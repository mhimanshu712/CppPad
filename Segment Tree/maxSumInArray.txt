Maximum Sum In Subarray
Send Feedback
You are given a sequence A[1], A[2], ..., A[N] . ( |A[i]| ≤ 15007 , 1 ≤ N ≤ 50000 ). A query is defined as follows:
Query(x,y) = Max { a[i]+a[i+1]+...+a[j] ; x ≤ i ≤ j ≤ y }.
Given M queries, your program must output the results of these queries.
Input
The first line of the input file contains the integer N.
In the second line, N numbers follow.
The third line contains the integer M.
M lines follow, where line i contains 2 numbers xi and yi.
Output
Your program should output the results of the M queries, one 
query per line.
Sample Input:
3 
-1 2 3 
1
1 2
Sample Output:
2
